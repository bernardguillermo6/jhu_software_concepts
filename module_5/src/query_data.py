Query predefined analytics from the PostgreSQL applicants table.

This module defines common analysis queries over the applicant data and
provides functions to execute them:

- `_get_questions_and_queries`: Returns the static list of (question, SQL).
- `run_queries`: Executes queries and returns results as dicts.
- `get_max_id`: Fetch the maximum applicant result ID from the DB.
- `main`: CLI entry point that prints results to stdout.
